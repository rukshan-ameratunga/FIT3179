        <h1>Weather patterns across Australia</h1>
        <p>The visualisation presented has been constructed using weather data from Australia over the years following the Millenium Drought in the 2000s, 
          Various facets of what makes up weather patterns in Australia has been presented in order to give the viewer a better understanding of the science behind the 
          physical phenoma we often take for granted.</p>

        <p>Relative humidity is given as the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the amount the air can actually hold. Warmer air is able to hold greater 
        moisture than colder air, this means keeping atmospheric pressure constant, the relative humidity will be lesser in warm air than in cold air. This negative 
        correlation is present across all States and Territories shown. Rain is also related to the water content in the air; humidity is at 100% when it rains. 
        The clouds are unable to hold any more water. This phenomena is particularly clear in WA and SA, heavier rains are experienced at higher relative humidity. When 
        the air is hotter, evaporation takes place, humidity increases and it rains, once the air has lost its water content, the temperature drops and we experience what 
        is known as a "cool change".</p>

        <p>Average rainfall is Australia is considered to be quite low, between 81 and 250 mm. Southern areas of the land experience rain-bearing cold spells when 
        high-pressure systems move toward to the north during Winter months. Monsoon season during the summer brings about much wet weather to the north, this is evident 
        in QLD and NT. Rainfall is typically concentrated along the eastern coastal regions (NSW, VIC, and parts of QLD). 2015 was a particularly poor year, being 5% below 
        the 1961-1990 climatological average of 465.2 mm. This is a 30 year average of a weather variable, namely rainfall, traditionally serving as the accepted norm by 
        meteorologists.</p>

          <p>An increasing trend in temperatures is prevalent here, this has been the case since 1910; until 2004 average yearly temperatures have been increasing by 0.7 Â°C. 
          Average temperatures are highest in the northerly regions and coastal areas. Areas with greater elevation are typically cooler, this is clear of states in the 
          south-east region, ie. Victoria, the ACT and parts of New South Wales. Discrepancy between maximum and minimum temperature values are low in QLD and rather high 
          in VIC.</p>

          <p>Average humidity in Western Australia is significantly lesser than that of states along the east coast. This is a continuing trend throughout the months 
            and years. The coast of WA experiences cold currents within the ocean, this means relatively low evaporation taking place and in turn, sparsely formed rain 
            clouds which do not produce a substantial amount of precipitation. To further illustrate this -  WA experiences roughly 250 - 350 mm of rainfall annually, 
            whereas QLD sees approximately 630 mm yearly. The distribution of rainfall goes hand in hand with relative humidity as presented in the 
            dot plot above.</p>
